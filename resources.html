  <h2>Famous Designers Who Inspire Me</h2>
  
  <p>
    The world of design is shaped by bold thinkers, creative rebels, and fearless visionaries, and among them, three names have deeply influenced my own journey. 
    <strong>Paula Scher</strong> taught me the power of typography as a form of expression, how letters themselves can scream, whisper, dance, or demand attention. Her approach to design isn’t just functional,it’s poetic.
    <strong>David Carson</strong> inspires me to break rules when necessary, to trust intuition over rigid templates. He reminds me that design isn't always about what is clean, sometimes it's about what feels alive. 
    And then there's <strong>Stefan Sagmeister</strong>, whose deeply human and emotional work shows that design is more than visuals,it’s storytelling, honesty, and vulnerability woven into form.
  </p>

  <p>
    These artists don’t just create, they express, provoke, and move people. Through their works, I’ve learned that design is not about being perfect. It’s about being 'authentic', about having something to say and saying it in a way only you can. Their careers inspire me to trust my creative instincts, embrace curiosity, and believe in the quiet power of visuals that speak louder than words.
